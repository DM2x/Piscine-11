# Piscine-11

The Piscine is a phase of the selection process that lasts 26 days and
involves face-to-face experience at the 42 Lisboa campus. This is a very
intense period of great commitment and enormous learning. I spent about
12 hours each day on the piscine, studying and learning about
programming.
During the Piscine, I learned a lot about programming basics and the
importance of working as a team.
I did 2 projects in Shell and 8 projects in C. Every Friday I had an exam of
4 hours duration and the last one was 8 hours duration. Each weekend I
had to do a group project called "RUSH". We were 3 people in each group,
working to finish a designated project. This Rush project was about stuff
we didn't know yet, so was where I improved the most.
In the end, I got into one of the best programming schools in the world!
